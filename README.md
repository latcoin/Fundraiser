```

### Service Providers
To run Crowdhoster you'll also need to sign up for the following:

* a [Balanced](https://www.balancedpayments.com/) account (test marketplace and live marketplace)
* the [Crowdtilt API](https://www.crowdtilt.com/learn/developers) - Email [support.api@crowdtilt.com](mailto:support.api@crowdtilt.com?subject=API Key Request for Crowdhoster&body=Hi! I'd like to deploy a Crowdhoster app. The Github readme sent me here to ask for an API key. Thanks!) to get your API keys
* [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (free) and set up a bucket for your assets. The bucket should be in the US Standard (us-east-1) zone.
* [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/) (free)

### Local Setup

Get  started by:

* Downloading a .zip of the [latest release](https://github.com/Crowdtilt/Crowdhoster/releases) to your local machine

  or

* Creating a fork of Crowdhoster and cloning it to your local machine.



After you've got the repo on your local machine, switch to the newly created project directory

```
$ cd {DIRECTORY}
```

Create a .env file in the project rootâ€¦easiest way is to create a copy of the .env.example file


```
$ cp .env.example .env
```


Then open up the .env file and fill in the variables with your app_name and credentials. Leave ```ENABLE_ASSET_SYNC``` set to 'true' if you plan to use AWS to host your assets (recommended). The bucket for asset syncing should be in the US Standard (us-east-1) zone.

The ```SECRET_TOKEN``` variable should be at least 30 characters and all random, no regular words or you'll be exposed to dictionary attacks.  You can generate a new one by running this command from the root of your project directory:

```
$ rake secret
```

Important: Your ```APP_NAME``` must not have a space in it. Underscores and hypens are accepted.

```
APP_NAME=myawesomeapp
CROWDTILT_SANDBOX_KEY=crowdtiltsandboxkey
CROWDTILT_SANDBOX_SECRET=crowdtiltsandboxsecret
ENABLE_ASSET_SYNC=true
AWS_BUCKET=awsbucket
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=awsaccesskey
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=awssecretaccesskey
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=myawesomeapp.mailgun.org
MAILGUN_PASSWORD=mailgunpassword
MAILGUN_USERNAME=postmaster@myawesomeapp.mailgun.org
SECRET_TOKEN=secrettoken
```

Install the gems

```
$ bundle install
```

Create and migrate the DB

```
$ foreman run rake db:create
$ foreman run rake db:migrate
```

Start the server

```
$ foreman start
```

Run the console

```
$ foreman run rails c
```

### Deploying to Heroku

1. [Sign up for a Heroku Account](https://www.heroku.com/)
2. [Install the Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)

Create a new Heroku app

```
$ heroku create {APP NAME}
```

Enable the use of environment variables during asset precompiling

```
$ heroku labs:enable user-env-compile
```

Install the Heroku config plugin if you don't already have it installed

```
$ heroku plugins:install git://github.com/ddollar/heroku-config.git
```

Push the configuration to Heroku.
NOTE: If you have already written config vars to Heroku, they will not be overwritten unless you pass the `--overwrite` flag as well.

```
$ heroku config:push
```

Deploy the code to Heroku

```
$ git push heroku master
```

Migrate the database

```
$ heroku run rake db:migrate
```

Launch the app!

```
$ heroku open
```

(Optional) It is highly recommended to install the Papertrail addon to create searchable logs should you run into issues. The "choklad" level is free.

```
$ heroku addons:add papertrail:choklad
```
